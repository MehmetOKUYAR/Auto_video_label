# Auto Video Labeling

Data is a huge factor in deep learning algorithms. The larger our data size, the better our model can generalize and learn.
However, data preparation is a very laborious and time-consuming process. That's why I wanted to develop an application that I thought would make this stage easier.
By using image processing techniques, it can track an object of your choice to a certain extent and saves the image and .txt file to the folder during tracking.
**Currently, it only works for one class and you can only label one object.**

**Note:** it does not work very stable in videos with multivariate background

### You can download the application using this link
[Download - auto_video_labeling.exe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t0bHjMo3m41nOevacauQEcUu33D3r9aU/view?usp=sharing) 

### 1. Open the application

**You can also run it like this** `python main.py`

### For ubuntu 

**requirements --> opencv-contrib-python==4.2.0.34**

**You should run it like this** `python3 auto_label.py --video video.mp4 --className label --perFrame 1 --classId 0`


### 2. Fill in the relevant fields. If you leave it blank, the default values will be accepted.

**Load video path :** Specify the video path you want to label. If you leave it blank, your camera will open.



**Save per frame:** Saved to one file per frame based on the value entered

**Class Name :** Specifies the folder name and label name to be saved. **Note**: It cannot contain Turkish characters.

**Class Id :** label id must be entered
